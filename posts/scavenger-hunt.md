We weren't quite sure if this was the right spot, but we figured we'd shoot it here since it was right across the building anyways!

We all immediately knew where this would be since we all passed by it while walking to class, haha.

Oh wow, this one was probably the most time-consuming and troublesome one to find. We tried looking through the "art" section of the RMIT library at first, but Jill suggested trying to use the library search provided, so we did, but the problem was that we still didn't know how to read the locations stated of the book by the website. We ended up going to the upper floor and asking a librarian for help who thankfully helped us after 30 minutes of arduous suffering.
